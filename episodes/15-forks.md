:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How to contribute to projects where I don't have permissions to push changes directly?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Until now, we've had permissions in the Owner repository to commit changes directly
on the 'main' branch (as covered on Episode 11. Collaborating), or to create a new branch
with our proposed changes and push it (as covered on Episode 12. Branches).
We have yet to cover a case where we don't those permissions, where we only have "read
access" to the repository. This can be the case of a project with a big number of potential collaborators
where it's risky to give write access to everyone, for example, an open-source project
that has dozens or hundreds of collaborators.
